# ML System Architecture

## Models Implemented
1. **Pose Detector** - Real-time joint angle analysis
2. **Form Analyzer** - Exercise-specific form scoring
3. **Fatigue Detector** - Performance degradation tracking

## Key Features
- Real-time pose estimation simulation
- Multi-metric form scoring (depth, posture, symmetry)
- Progressive fatigue detection
- Exercise phase recognition

## API Endpoints
- `/api/analyze/<exercise>` - ML-powered exercise analysis
- `/api/stats` - ML analytics dashboard
- `/api/camera/start` - ML-enhanced camera system
